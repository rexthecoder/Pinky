- set the channel you added the bot to. eg. `channel:general`

## Setting up  Telegram

> We planning to have our custom chatbot who does the work automatically.After the next update, you will automate things at ease.


- <details>
  <summary> Create a bot with BotFather.</summary>
  <ul>
   <li>Start a new conversation with the <a href="https://telegram.me/ botfather">`BotFather`</a></li>

   <li>Send /newbot to create a new Telegram bot.</li>

   <li>When asked, enter a name for the bot.</li>

   <li>Give the Telegram bot a unique username. Note that the bot name must end with the word "bot" (case-insensitive).</li>

   <li>Copy and save the Telegram bot's access token for later steps.</li>
  </ul>
</details>


- Provide the access token to our `telegram_token`

- Copy your channel id. The channel you want the apk to be sent to. ( Make sure the bot has been added over there).


## How to get Telegram channel id

> Skip step 2 if your channel is public

  1. log in under your account at web version of [`Telegram`](https://web.telegram.org). Incase your channel is public, just copy the channel name as the `telegram_chat_id`.

  2. Find your channel. See to your URL. It should be like https://web.telegram.org/z/#-1543515057.

  3. Grab "1543515057" from it, and add "-100" as a prefix.


## Setting up Discord

> Note that, discord has file limit size(8mb) for channels which has no booster

 - Watch this [`video`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzdZLWonn0Y) to learn how to get your webhook. 
 - Copy the webhook link and provide it to `webhook_url`

 That's all you need to get discord to work.
